Introduction
The project aims to perform data analysis on a survey done to understand the satisfaction of customers of mobile service providers in Singapore. The analysis will include functions that will be able to perform data cleaning tasks such as dealing with missing data and unwanted data. This will allow the program to create several visualisations of the data such as pie charts and line graphs which will help the user to observe trends.
Data to be used
Our data will be generated by GenAI, which simulates filling out a sample survey with the following questions, to generate 200 unique responses. 


Basic information of personal details such as year of birth and gender
Surveyor’s current telco provider
Satisfactory level on a scale of 1 to 5 which includes reception and customer support service
Open-ended questions that allow Surveyors to express any concerns which are not listed in the survey question
The GenAI will output the response data in Excel/CSV format, with table headers. However, missing data and inconsistencies will be present.

Expected outcomes
Our app will be able to:
·        Process the Data and clean it upon receiving the input such as
·        Removal of unwanted information and incomplete data
·        Have a dashboard with comprehensive graphs displaying data clearly
·        Providing insights into data trends 
·        A clearer understanding of the data by presenting summary statistics and data distribution
